# 📝 Automated-Text-Summarization

This project focuses on summarizing long text documents using both extractive and abstractive methods with machine learning and deep learning techniques.

---

## 🚀 Objective
Build a model to automatically summarize large text using NLP and machine learning.

---

## 🧠 Approach

- Preprocessed text using tokenization and word embeddings.
- Implemented extractive and abstractive summarization techniques.
- Built a Seq2Seq model with LSTM and attention using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Evaluated performance using ROUGE metrics.

---

## 📊 Result
Generated concise summaries with improved ROUGE scores compared to basic extractive methods.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- TensorFlow, Keras  
- NLTK  
- ROUGE

---

## 📁 Dataset

Used publicly available datasets like CNN/DailyMail and custom text samples.

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Add Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, T5)  
- Create a simple UI for summary generation
